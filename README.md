The Brief

The Client’s mystery shopping programme consists of visits to each of the client’s ten locations, grouped into five 

different areas. Each location receives a single visit each month, but on occasion a visit may not take place.

On the completion of each visit, a questionnaire is completed by the mystery shopper that is used to rate the 

service they received during the visit. The completed questionnaire is assigned a score, which is calculated based 

on the number of points achieved over the number of points available, normally expressed as a percentage. 

Points Achieved x 100 = % Score Points Available

The Client has requested that an end of year report is generated to summarise the data collected over the previous 

year. The report should be easy to understand and show as much useful information as possible.

Requirements

============================

A PHP application should be created to generate the required report and example data will be provided in a CSV 

file. Ideally an RDBMS (such as MySQL) should be used, but it is not essential, and any data 

manipulation should be done by the application.
